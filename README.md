# Insites Next Starter Kit - Frontend

**What's inside:**

## Installation

_Prerequisite:_ This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The home page can be found and edited at `pages/index.js`.

[Dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/dynamic-slug](http://localhost:3000/dynamic-slug). These routes allow for dynamic pages to be handled and can be edited at `pages/[...slug].js`.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/preview](http://localhost:3000/api/preview). These endpoints can be edited in `pages/api/`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
